This README file explains how to use the GAP code in the file "ZCTU.txt" to check the status of the Zassenhaus conjecture on torsion units of ZG for small groups.  

STEP 1: Install and compile the HeLP package, and its integer optimization programs "normaliz" and "4ti2".  Instructions for how to do this can be found in GAP's /pkg/help/README file

STEP 2: Start GAP and do 
gap>Read("ZCTU.txt"); 

STEP 3: Choose the group order n you want to test. Run 
gap>FindZCCriticalGroups(n);  

The output is a list in the form [ r, k, PA ] where SmallGroup(n,r) is the group G, k is the order of the torsion unit u, and PA is the list of partial augmentations of u generated by HeLP.  The program only reports one nontrivial HeLP+-solution in each orbit of the automorphism group of G.   


If one wishes to test a single group for ZC, use the following sequence of commands: 

  (i) Define the group in GAP somehow, for example, 
  gap>G:=SmallGroup(n,r); 

  (ii) Define its character table: 
  gap>C:=CharacterTable(G); 
	- Note: For groups in the Atlas, the character table and group should be linked.  See "ZCTU.txt" comments for further instruction. 

  (iii) Run HeLP+ on this group. 
  gap>HeLP_WithSolverChange(G); 
  
  The output is true or false.  The solutions are saved in a global variable HeLP_sol, which lists the partial augmentations of each unit and its powers. 

	- Note: If only one solver (either normaliz or 4ti2) is compiled, use gap>HeLP_ZC(G); 
	- Warning: This may take a lot of time with one solver. 


  (iv) Determine the list of nontrivial Aut(G)-orbits of nontrivial HeLP+-solutions for units of order k. 
  gap>L:=AutOrbs(C,k,HeLP_sol[k]);

  (v) Apply the quotient method to the output of step 6. 
  Set PA to be one element of the list L, for example, 
  gap> PA:=L[1];  
  To this element apply 
  gap>V:=TranslatePAForQuotientMethod(C,k,PA);  
  gap>QuotientMethod(G,V);

  The return is true if the PA list is nontrivial in a proper quotient of G, in this case the nontrivial HeLP+-solution is resolved because it cannot give a minimal counterexample to the Zassenhaus conjecture.  The return is false if its' image is always trivial, in this case the nontrivial HeLP+-solution is not     resolved by the quotient method. 

  (vi) Apply the partially central unit construction method to a PA defined as in Step 6. 
  gap>V:=TranslatePAForPartiallyCentral(C,k,PA); 
  gap>IsPartiallyCentralUnit:=function(G,V); 

  The return is true if the unit constructed is partially central.  This means the conclusion of the Zassenhaus conjecture holds for units satisfying the conditions of this HeLP+-solution.  Otherwise it returns a false.
